# Web_Scraping
"This project involved web scraping a job listings website to collect valuable data related to the field of data analysis in Egypt.
We utilized Python, Beautiful Soup, and Selenium to extract job titles, locations, experience requirements, education levels, and other job-related information. 
The data was then organized into a structured format, making it easier for users to search and find relevant job opportunities."
